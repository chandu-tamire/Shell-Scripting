Shell Script Basics:-


A shell script is a text file that contains a sequence of commands for a Unix-based shell, like Bash, to execute. These scripts can automate repetitive tasks, manage system operations, or configure environments.

Here’s a super simple example of a shell script in Bash:

# This is a simple shell script
#!/bin/bash

echo "Hello, World!"

1.  #!/bin/bash – This is called a shebang. It tells the system which interpreter to use for the script (in this case, Bash).
2.  echo "Hello, World!" – This prints "Hello, World!" to the terminal.


# Common Use Cases:

1. Automation: Running backups, system updates, and maintenance tasks.

2. System Configuration: Setting environment variables, configuring servers, etc.

3. Task Scheduling: Running scripts at specific times using cron jobs.
